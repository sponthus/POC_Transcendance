      Transcendance is the last group common core project at 42 school. The goal is to create a website to play <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>, with a lot of modules around this concept : frontend, DevObs architecture, user authentification and chat, match history, online games and cybersecurity. 
      Therefore, many programming languages and concepts are expected and they are pretty new to me. This repo contains a few researched I've made on these concepts.
